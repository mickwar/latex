The "beamer_template/main.tex" file is meant to be a self-sufficient
file that provides a minimalistic beamer theme. No other files
required (excpect any packages that will be loaded).

This was motivated in part by the sometimes confusing (for me) usage
of existing beamer themes and not having the control I wanted. Also,
I wanted to have more control of what was occurring. I prefer the
simple and non-decorative apporach when it comes to slides. I feel
the fluff often distracts from the presentation and makes for ugly
slides filled with too much garbage. This "theme" is meant to be
very simple.
